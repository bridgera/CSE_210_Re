Version control is the process of recording changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can access specific versions. It enables multiple developers to collaborate on a single project. If developers want to work on different features for an application, version control allows them to develop and test their code independently on separate branches before merging it with the main codebase. Most version control systems permit the review of changes and resolution of any errors arising from merging branches. If something breaks, it's easy to revert to a previous, functional version of the repository. Git is one of the most common version control systems and is accessible through the terminal. A frequently used Git command is "git pull," which fetches changes from the main codebase to your local branch.
